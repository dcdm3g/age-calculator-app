# Age Calculator App

![Preview](preview.png)

## Hello! ðŸ’«

This is my solution to the ["age calculator app" challenge by Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/age-calculator-app-dF9DFFpj-Q). I created this to improve my knowledge in React and algorithms, so **additional libraries were not used**.

## Running ðŸš€

If you want to run this app in your machine, make sure you have NodeJS and Git installed and run the following commands:

```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/dcdm3g/age-calculator-app

# Go to the created folder
cd age-calculator-app

# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Start the NextJS development server
pnpm dev
```
